--------------------------------------------------------------------LOVE SANDWICHES

________________________________Introduction

Python in real world context

Build a project called Love SANDWICHES

A command line based Python program to handle data  automation for a 
fictional sandwich company.

Love Sandwiches runs a local market stall, selling  a small range of 
sandwiches.
For each market day, their staff pre-make stock to sell. If they sell out 
of a particular sandwich, their staff make extra for their customers. 
And the unsold  ones are thrown away at the end of the day.

we need to make a program that:
              collects the company's market day sales data
              calculate the surplus for the day
              produce reccommendations for the number of each sandwich to make
                  for the next market day
              
        goal to save staff time by automating a repetitive task
                reduce surplus

we will wire up our Python to interact with a Google Sheet- and be able
   to push and pull data to and from the spreadsheet

Itâ€™s important to note here that when you want  to access and manipulate data from a spreadsheet
you should keep the information within  your tables in clean rows and columns.
Just column headings and cells of data.
